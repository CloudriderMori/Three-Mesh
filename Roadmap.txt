Roadmap
-------

- improve vertical alignment of text. Currently it's done with the font ascender and descender, it should be done by checking individual characters ascenders and descender in one line, for a perfect interline consistancy

- optimise to do less useless updates

- look into reducing letters poly count

- add width/height: auto
